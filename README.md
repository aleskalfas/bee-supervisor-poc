# üêù Bee Supervisor

A proof-of-concept implementation of a multi-agent task management system that demonstrates hierarchical agent coordination and task execution.

## Features

- **Agent Registry**: Manages different types of agents and maintains agent pools

  - Dynamic agent type registration
  - Configurable agent pools for resource optimization
  - Automatic pool management and cleanup
  - Agent lifecycle management (create, destroy, acquire, release)

- **Task Runner**: Handles task scheduling and execution with robust controls

  - Task scheduling with configurable intervals
  - Permission-based task management
  - Retry mechanism with configurable delays
  - Task history tracking
  - Occupancy control for task access

- **Permission System**: Comprehensive access control
  - Owner-level permissions
  - Agent-level permissions
  - Admin privileges
  - Granular task access control

## Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

### Agent Registry

Manages the lifecycle of agents and their configurations.

Key features:

- Agent type registration and configuration
- Pool management for agent reuse
- Agent lifecycle hooks
- Dynamic scaling of agent pools

### Task Runner

Handles task execution and scheduling.

Key features:

- Task scheduling and execution
- Retry mechanisms
- History tracking
- Occupancy control

## Showcase: Poetry Generation System

The following showcase demonstrates the system's capabilities through a poetry generation example. In this scenario, the system coordinates multiple agents to generate poems on different topics.

### System Flow

1. **Agent Type Registration**: The supervisor registers a "poet" agent type
2. **Agent Pool Creation**: Creates a pool of 5 poet agents
3. **Task Distribution**: Schedules poetry tasks for different topics:
   - Bee
   - Hive
   - Queen
   - Sun
   - Flowers
4. **Task Execution**: Each agent generates a unique poem for its assigned topic
5. **Result Collection**: The supervisor collects and presents all generated poems

## Run

`npm start`

### Example Output

Here's a sample of the generated poems:
